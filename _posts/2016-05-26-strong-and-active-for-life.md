<article style=""><h1>Strong and active for life!</h1></article>

Welcome to Re:fitness -- that could mean coming back to fitness having had a family, after illness or injury or regarding fitness that you think it's about time you did something more than you have been.

As for me, I am a highly qualified, friendly and enthusiastic Personal Trainer working in and around Winchester. But it's all about you -- what you want to achieve and why you are thinking of engaging a Personal Trainer.

There are many reasons my clients come for fun but challenging sessions with me:

\* Weight Loss

\* Returning to fitness after having a baby

\* Changing body needs and abilities due to age

\* Loss of muscle and strength

\* Specific event Training

\* Public gym avoidance!

I can help you achieve your health and fitness goals no matter what they are and no matter where you are starting from.

It's all about getting and staying strong and active for life! 9
