<article style=""><h1>Where to train?</h1></article>

**Where to train?**

Everywhere is a potential workout location -- in your front room, in your garden, local park e.t.c but I can offer you a variety of options:

**In your own home**

I can come to you with a variety of fitness equipment to ensure a fun but challenging and effective work out. We can then see what you can use in your own home to continue your fitness programme when I'm not there.

**Outdoors**

We are incredibly lucky in Winchester to have a great variety of places to train outdoors, it has it all: parks, forests, hills, wide open spaces. We can train rain or shine or we could mix it up and train outdoors when the sun shines and hop indoors when it's nasty outside. Our sessions will be hard but don't need to be unpleasant and wet if you don't want them to be.

**Private Gym**

I am lucky enough to have the luxury of offering a private, well equipped gym in my home. Sorry kids you lost the playroom!

It has more weights than you could lift (I'm really not going to be training bodybuilders am I?), treadmill, punch bags, pads, kettlebells, -- come and see for yourself.

It allows you to get out of your own home but without the fear or unease of working out in a public gym (nothing wrong at all with these).

I have a private shower room if you need to change and go on somewhere.
