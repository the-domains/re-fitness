**Weight Loss**

If you want to lose weight -- this is really a lifestyle change programme as it will incorporate a specific exercise programme for optimal weight loss but also dietary advice and consultation.

There is no good coming to me for great sessions once or twice a week then eating too much of the wrong foods that won't give your body the fuel you need to achieve your goals.

You will have contact with me more than your PT sessions!!

**Pre and Post Natal**

All mums have a different pregnancy journey -- I've been there...3 times. It's about working with you throughout pregnancy to ensure that you and your baby see the benefits of a regular specific exercise programme that keeps you both safe. Or working with you, however tired, after your 6 or 12 week check up to help you return to the shape you want.

**50+**

Now we all know 30 is the new 20 and 50 is definitely the new 40 -- but no matter what age, our bodies do change. I work with older clients to maintain strength and mobility.

That does not mean we only practice for indoor bowling and fall avoidance....(no offence to indoor bowlers -- it's an active sport). Just because our bodies are aging does not mean we can't do strenuous, challenging and progressive workouts -- it just means we have to listen to our bodies and tweak certain exercises accordingly.

**Strength Training**

I am passionate about keeping people strong for life! If you don't use it you lose it! Strong muscles promote strong bones and can prevent osteoporosis. Ladies - you won't get big bulky muscles unless you are taking steroids -- which I never have, never will and I hope nobody I know would contemplate.

Whether it's carting the shopping, carrying a baby, carrying your Grandson/daughter, carting manure -- we all need to increase or maintain our strength.

**Event Training**

Everywhere you look there seems to be a Race for Life, 5km, 10km, Â½ marathon, full marathon, tri's, bi's - the choice is yours and there will always be an event out there for you if you want to set your sights on something. I will work with you to design a programme to get you there and to achieve your event goal.

**Couples and Friends**

It's always great having a workout buddy. It's good for motivation -- although I will give you plenty of that -- and cheaper too. One PT session a week is great but not quite enough so setting you joint workout goals over the week for you each to work towards means you are more likely to do it if somebody else is relying on you.

It does help if you are of a similar starting fitness -- then it is competition on!

**You and your dog**

Time short but still need to find time to train and walk your dog -- combine the two. I have a few locations up my sleeve where we can let the dog run and structure a work out depending on you and your dog's needs. I am an excellent ball thrower while you are getting down and dirty!
