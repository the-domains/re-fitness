<article style=""><h1>A little about me</h1></article>

I am a mum of three gorgeous girls + Willow the dog and wife to David.

I have always been interested in Sport and fitness. In my 20's, I taught aerobics in clubs in and around London. My passion is skiing and I was lucky that my career path saw me managing the Daily Mail Ski and Snowboard Show for a few years too. For the last eight years, David and I have ran our own business in Home Care (Nobilis.co.uk) -- that's still going but this is MY lifestyle plan. I am delighted to have returned the fitness industry as a Professional Personal Trainer.

I am passionate about keeping people fit and active in order to lead long and healthy lives. Too many of the clients we support through Nobilis have poor mobility or illness due to inactive lifestyles and poor diet choices. We can all make the difference NOW to be fit and healthy for the lives we want to lead.

I have achieved my Level 3 Personal Training Qualification and Diploma in Personal Training. I have specialised in Pre and Post-natal and 50 + clients as I know more about these client groups from personal experience but I train anybody of any age...apart from my husband who won't be told a thing!!

My winter passion is still skiing, I run, cycle and play competitive netball. I know how hard it is to fit it all into a busy lifestyle but it's about making the fitness choices that work for you.

My husband and I have just completed our second Tough Mudder and I _think_ I have caught the Triathlon bug having completed the Ferndown Triathlon last year and booked up for another one soon.

Do I always practice what I preach -- nope but we are all human and some days are better than others!
